# Hint 1:
If SOC is above 80%, aggressive energy-saving actions are not necessary unless requested by the human.

# Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the system should operate in balanced mode, maintaining both acceptable QoS and reasonable energy consumption.

# Hint 3:
If the throughput is below the required QoS reference, performance must be prioritized.

# Hint 4:
If the QoS margin is greater than 10% above the required level, performance can be safely reduced to improve energy efficiency.

# Hint 5:
If SOC is close to the safety threshold, energy-saving strategies should be activated even if performance is acceptable.

# Hint 6:
Minor throughput fluctuations within 3% of the reference are considered negligible and do not require immediate strategy changes.

# Hint 7:
If computational power increases without corresponding QoS improvement, the system is operating inefficiently.

# Hint 8:
Rapid increases in total power without significant task performance change indicate over-provisioning of resources.

# Hint 9:
If the human requires higher performance, first compare current throughput with the required QoS reference before increasing frequencies.

# Hint 10:
If no human instruction is given and the system is stable (QoS satisfied, SOC safe), maintain the current strategy.

# Hint 11:
If conflicting conditions arise (e.g., low SOC and QoS violation), prioritize safety constraints before performance improvement.
